## whoami

born in chicago 🐂, raised in charlotte 👑. keywords: js, startups, music, university, and ai

i use js to build on the web, for the web. originally i was meant to follow the traditional software engineering path, but soon i found myself co-founding a startup to help rappers overcome writers' block. my journey towards production-grade programming began with js, react, next, gpt2 (before the rise of chatgpt), and aws sagemaker. plus talking to humans to solve the right problem. that's important for any production-grade program to be useful to humans, of course.

blessed, i earned a spot at the nation's top university startup accelerator: the iventure accelerator at urbana-champaign,
sponsored by the gies college of business. as a computer engineer i still didn't feel out of place, what with 9 different colleges represented
in my cohort in 2021. i later had the opportunity to give back alongside a brilliant leadership team. in short, it was lifechanging.

## rn

right now im trying to get an internship for the summer, so im working on a project i like - a music app for myself. can
you tell i like music. check readme in [./keshlib/music-app/](./keshlib/music-app/).

also absorbing stoic philosophy, which is why im practicing to write. marcus
aurelius wrote his *meditations* after his tutor died, so he can teach himself for himself.
since i keep a closed-source journal on my local machine, let this be a way to share my work to the Internet.

## foreword

since earning a spot at my university startup accelerator my freshman year, my perspective towards engineering has changed quite meaningfully. and i mean that word in every sense.

my work as an engineer must be *meaningful*. else, i don't actually mean to do good work. a big weakness i've found in myself is that i can fall in love with the *idea* of the thing rather than the thing itself. i'd like to avoid that.

the best work is meaningful work. meaningful work is something that helps a certain group of people solve a certainly painful problem in a way meaningful to them. find clarity in the big three (people, pains, and meaning).

you only know what is meaningful to them by *talking* to them. that's probably why i tend to first research, then build. i've felt additional disadvantages here too, when building quickly

if i want to move with any sort of meaningful velocity, first find a meaningful *direction* then *speed* towards that.

### direction

why js?
- seemed like the most popular way to get something working quickly for people (React)
- cared about website design because i'm on Mac
- cared about website usability because i'm on iOS
- cared about accessiblity in that i don't want to write in multiple languages yet

i started thinking in terms of apis and routes. build a resource once and call it whenever your app needs. this philosphy made sense for me and fullstack web developers - you should write your ui and application code once, however you'd like, and deploy it to many platforms via the Internet. likewise, defining your infrastructure programmatically lets you progressively maintain it, instead of tearing it down through the AWS console. thank you [sst](https://sst.dev/)

also:
- i knew i could add websites to my iOS homescreen to make a nice app if i wanted (except in EU 😭)
- shipping fullstack felt like a superpower
- reasoned that the Internet, as a platform, would only get better with time
- realized an opportunity to go way beyond my ece curriculum and soak up how something like the Internet came about...

javascript, as a whole, looked like a really solid introduction to a my eventual career. it's something that i don't feel much friction to get up and learn about. and it gets things done for people. it's what my cofounder and i mainly used to build our tech startup

for my career:
- i could choose to do frontend or backend programming with javascript (data-heavy apps with web frameworks like Remix/Next or lighter apps with Astro/Node)
- aws lambda offers Node runtimes to spin up javascript - a doorway into the aws ecosystem


i've been mostly interested in how javascript could do everything for me.

i could pursue a career in fullstack web development, or i could focus on the backend with node, or perhaps just in the frontend with react (where most of my time was honestly spent).

as a computer engineering student, i could learn to code in a language made for the Internet, providing a more complete education atop my electrical-biased computer engineering curriculum at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

i read *Refactoring UI* and learned to implement design principles.

i also was interested in avoiding deployment costs. i could still imagine, as a university freshman, the horror stories of AWS bills. was definitely motivated to build only for serverless.

## why all of this?

- complete package for my various pursuits
- cater towards different audiences from IG, X, and GH
- complete ownership over something like my [bento](https://bento.me/keshsad)
- demonstrate skills as a programmer
- practice writing and building

## how all of this?
