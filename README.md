# My Experience

I have some buckets myself:

- web dev
- meditation (approach, practice, and integration)
- music
- thought

Mind dump everything about me for now, pick the important pieces later.

I also have some experience:

- Co-Founder and Software Engineer at Poetic (from Fall 2021 -> Fall 2023)
- Program Fellow (iV9 from Summer 2023 -> Spring 2024) and iVenture Accelerator alum (iV8 from Summer 2022 -> Spring 2023)
- Computer Engineering at Urbana-Champaign (Fall 2021 - Fall 2023, 23 credits from graduation)

I can find a practical and low-overhead way to send out my resume pdf. SST?

Apart from the beauty and entrepreneurial productivity of the iVenture community + the personal growth that evolved with me throughout building Poetic (reword that), what else is there to share? Do I really want to put on my music? (Oh I'll make an app for that). Close the gap between my Twitter and digital profile? Share pictures? I care about those things, and other people would love to see them. It would help my personal brand. But I need to be focused. What problem does this website solve? For whom does it solve for?

## Problem

- My socials need a website (Instagram, Twitter, GitHub)
- If I'm any good full-stack developer, I'd have a personal site that demonstrates that?? 😭 (mobile-first good-nav tailwind dark/light)
- socials -> brand > linktree
- Faster way to glance at my work experience for my Career, GitHub, and Twitter friends
- Better way to actually learn in-depth about the above. stories in bytes is easier than full writeups per important thing. think in features not versions
- I wish I was a good writer. I get by for now. Selling yourself is a fundamental skill of social creatures. If it's hard to sell by telling, then maybe I should take you straight to the code I'm trying to figure out too 😂. No need to stress about "ah I gotta build this for aslidjf reason" just build and comment and you good
- One place where I can complain about all the surprisingly shit software out there and Hopefully build it myself

## Participants

- Tech Twitter
- Instagram friends
- Developers on GitHub
- Entrepreneurial-minded friends from iVenture, UIUC, and beyond

# Bruhs

- Spotify live player is much better
- Apple Music search sucks
- Apple Music search bar on nav bar focuses keyboard
- Providers never in sync
- Apple Music full screen is simply gas
- Apple Music does not implement Optimistic UI, makes it confusing with my workflow: always sort big list of likes by recently added, shuffle and relike (change color of heart emoji to background, default black, to make UI fun to use)
- Apple Music lyrics are clean
- SoundCloud and YouTube have all the unreleased songs
- A consistently great group jam

Since there a few buckets that I need to write about, I'll separate into subdirectories:

- [Music App]()
