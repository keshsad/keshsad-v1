To improve as a basketball player, you must play games against the best.
To improve as a producer, you must produce every day.
To improve as a software developer... write software.

It's of course easier said than done, but that's exactly why I'm taking the first step here.

I might add some random bits to practice coding. Or I might not. Just trying to reduce the friction. Forget notion, apple notes, obsidian, or what have you.

Everything public. Hidden in commit history :)

### WIP

Some examples:

1. [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
2. [Manu Edakara](https://www.manuedakara.com/purpose)
3. [Luke Clancy](https://lukeclancy.me/)

I have some buckets:
- web dev
- meditation (approach, practice, and integration)
- music
- thought
- sports (formula 1, boxing, basketball, tennis)

Mind dump everythin about me for now, pick the important pieces later.
