## problem

- my socials need a website (instagram, twitter, github)
- if i'm any good full-stack developer, i'd have a personal site that demonstrates that?? 😭 (mobile-first good-nav tailwind dark/light)
- socials -> brand > linktree
- faster way to glance at my work experience for my career, github, and twitter friends
- better way to actually learn in-depth about the above. stories in bytes is easier than full writeups per important thing. think in features not versions
- i wish i was a good writer. i get by for now. selling yourself is a fundamental skill of social creatures. if it's hard to sell by telling, then maybe i should take you straight to the code i'm trying to figure out too 😂. no need to stress about "ah i gotta build this for aslidjf reason" just build and comment and you good
- one place where i can complain about all the surprisingly shit software out there and hopefully build it myself
