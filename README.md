## whoami

born in chicago 🐂, raised in charlotte 👑. keywords: js, startups, music, university, and ai

i use js to build on the web, for the web. originally i was meant to follow the traditional software engineering path, but soon i found myself building a startup to help rappers overcome writers' block. my journey towards production-grade programming began with js, react, gpt2 (before the rise of chatgpt), and aws. after struggling to overcome the black box of amplify, i discovered next, vercel, and tailwindcss. these technologies are what first brought me to modern full-stack web development.

blessed, i earned a spot at the nation's top university startup accelerator: the [iventure accelerator](https://iventure.illinois.edu/) at urbana-champaign 🌽, sponsored by the gies college of business. as a computer engineer, i still didn't feel out of place, what with 9 different colleges represented in my cohort in 2021. i later had the opportunity to give back alongside a brilliant leadership team. it was a lifechanging experience.

## my experience

- co-founder and software engineer at poetic (from fall 2021 -> fall 2023)
- program fellow (iv9 from summer 2023 -> spring 2024) and iventure accelerator alum (iv8 from summer 2022 -> spring 2023)
- computer engineering at urbana-champaign (fall 2021 - fall 2023, 23 credits from graduation)
