## whoami

born in chicago 🐂, raised in charlotte 👑. keywords: js, startups, music, university, and ai

i use js to build on the web, for the web. originally i was meant to follow the traditional software engineering path, but soon i found myself building a startup to help rappers overcome writers' block. my journey towards production-grade programming began with js, react, next, gpt2 (before the rise of chatgpt), and aws. plus, talking to humans to solve the right problem... that's important for any production-grade program to be useful to humans, of course.

blessed, i earned a spot at the nation's top university startup accelerator: the [iventure accelerator](https://iventure.illinois.edu/) at urbana-champaign 🌽, sponsored by the gies college of business. as a computer engineer, i still didn't feel out of place, what with 9 different colleges represented in my cohort in 2021. i later had the opportunity to give back alongside a brilliant leadership team. it was a lifechanging experience.

## rn

right now im trying to get an internship for the summer, so im working on a project i like - a therapy app. check the readme in [./keshlib/therapy-app/](./keshlib/therapy-app/) for updates.

i've also been introducing myself to stoic philosophy. this is why im practicing to write. marcus
aurelius wrote his [Meditations](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.html) after his tutor died, so he can
teach himself for himself.

## foreword

since earning a spot at my university startup accelerator my freshman year, my perspective towards engineering has changed quite meaningfully. and i mean that word in every sense.

my work as an engineer must be *meaningful*. else, i don't actually mean to do good work. a big weakness i've found in myself is that i can fall in love with the *idea* of the thing rather than the thing itself. i'd like to avoid that.

the best work is meaningful work. meaningful work is something that helps a certain group of people solve a certainly painful problem in a way meaningful to them. find clarity in the big three (people, pains, and meaning).

you only know what is meaningful to them by *talking* to people. that's probably why i tend to rigorously research, then build. i've felt additional disadvantages here too, when building quickly.

if i want to move with any sort of meaningful velocity, first find a meaningful *direction* then *speed* towards that.

### direction

**why js?**
- the Internet is a platform that is continuously improving and available for all
- could add websites to my iOS homescreen to make a native-like app (except in EU 😭)
- realized an opportunity to go beyond my ece curriculum and soak up how something like the Internet came about
- great developer experience on my Mac and iOS devices to study and implement mobile-first design
- react seemed popular
- didn't want to write in multiple languages yet

**serverless**
to build any production application, you'd need your application code to run on the server. perhaps you need to store
your users' data - then you need a database. and if you plan to have users, then you should think about an
authentication system. with javascript, i'd eventually get experience using cloud infrastructure providers like aws and
more modern interpretations like [vercel](https://vercel.com/home).

i also was interested in avoiding deployment costs. i could still imagine, as a university freshman, the horror stories of AWS bills. was definitely motivated to build only for serverless.

i started thinking in terms of apis and routes. build a resource once and call it whenever your app needs. this philosphy made sense for me and fullstack web developers - you should write your ui and application code once, however you'd like, and deploy it to many platforms via the Internet. likewise, defining your infrastructure programmatically (with something like [sst]([sst](https://sst.dev/)) lets you progressively maintain it, instead of tediously tearing it down through the AWS console. work with your hands, not your eyes. small startups and projects should pay per usage not time so serverless was the best route.

**design for developers?**
i read *Refactoring UI* and learned of the value of a design system. i just use [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/remix) and i'm trying not to look back at newer, [faster](https://lightningcss.dev/), or more [powerful](https://stylexjs.com/) ways to implement css styles. but i don't think i'll stop being curious about these things.

**career prospects**
i believed writing web apps with javascript would open doors for all the startups whose products are just websites. i
could choose to work on either frontend or backend whenever i wanted to, with react and node. i learned that data-heavy
applications can be built with Next or Remix and more static sites with Astro and fundamental web-standard apis.

javascript, as a whole, looked like a really solid introduction to a my eventual career. it's something that i didn't feel much friction to get up and learn about. it's what my cofounder and i mainly used to build our startup. javascript enables proper fullstack app development, and i believe [expo](https://expo.dev/) will bring it home for mobile.
