reduce the friction. everything public. hidden in commit history 🙏🏽

## problem

- my socials need a website (instagram, twitter, github)
- if i'm any good full-stack developer, i'd have a personal site that demonstrates that?? 😭 (mobile-first good-nav tailwind dark/light)
- socials -> brand > linktree
- faster way to glance at my work experience for my career, github, and twitter friends
- better way to actually learn in-depth about the above. stories in bytes is easier than full writeups per important thing. think in features not versions
- i wish i was a good writer. i get by for now. selling yourself is a fundamental skill of social creatures. if it's hard to sell by telling, then maybe i should take you straight to the code i'm trying to figure out too 😂. no need to stress about "ah i gotta build this for aslidjf reason" just build and comment and you good
- one place where i can complain about all the surprisingly shit software out there and hopefully build it myself

## participants

- tech twitter
- instagram friends
- developers on github
- entrepreneurial-minded friends from iventure, uiuc, and beyond

### 1. a better music experience

i think airbuds is a great step. i want to search and play my music from there too. or, i'll make it myself. inspired by [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/public/examples/music-dark.png).

- spotify live player is much better
- apple music search sucks
- apple music search bar on nav bar focuses keyboard
- providers never in sync
- apple music full screen is simply gas
- apple music does not implement optimistic ui, makes it confusing with my workflow: always sort big list of likes by recently added, shuffle and relike (change color of heart emoji to background, default black, to make ui fun to use)
- apple music lyrics are clean
- soundcloud and youtube have all the unreleased songs
- a consistently great group jam

### 2. a better therapy experience

in my junior year, i ran across a [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trained/id1414073313?i=1000417484122) with the senior director of performance at nike interviewing a british former buddhist monk. a pretty cool duo. i was deep into tennis at the time. it was also probably the best introduction i could've ever received.

i previously founded a startup to help songwriters write better lyrics on the rise of chatgpt. it was a really cool experience that nicely tied my hobby for listening to music to a constructive skill. moreover, i believe i started to care a lot more about the unique ability of humans to write. i was no good. there's a few examples:

- writing simply in entrepreneurship
- useful documentation for developers
- journaling
- thoughtful app content and tooltips
- buddhist monks and scribes that kept their practices

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about next.js, vercel, and tailwind. i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, the performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and the broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/).

let me tell you first that i was stuck in the abstracted yet beautiful land of vercel for quite a bit. after finding difficulties, i looked to meditations and was reminded to stay open-minded. change is inevitable, and any good experience is within my grasp. it's up to me to let go of difficulties and try new things. that's when i really started to look beyond the vercel world, paid attention to the sst team, and learned about remix and astro. i still saw go and solid doing great for people. the technological future is bright

### 3. a better fullstack entrepreneur experience

it's hard to be a developer. you can say it's even harder to be an entrepreneur. the biggest lessons i learned from both experiences is to:

- ask useful questions
- listen very closely

the problem is that there's a lot of questions and few good answers. a roadmap.sh would work.
