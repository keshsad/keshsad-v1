To improve as a basketball player, you must play games against the best.
To improve as a producer, you must produce every day.
To improve as a software developer... write software.

It's of course easier said than done, but that's exactly why I'm taking the first step here.

Basically, if it's too hard for me to decide what to work on, I'll have one place to store all the problems I notice in web dev and SWE. And how I can fix them, if I can. And perhaps some of the resources I used. Why hide my failures?

I'm just trying to reduce the friction. Everything public. Hidden in commit history 🙏🏽

# WIP

Some examples:

1. [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io/)
2. [Manu Edakara](https://www.manuedakara.com/purpose)
3. [Luke Clancy](https://lukeclancy.me/)

I have some buckets myself:
- web dev
- meditation (approach, practice, and integration)
- music
- thought
- sports (formula 1, boxing, basketball, tennis)

Mind dump everything about me for now, pick the important pieces later.

I also have some work experience:
- Co-Founder and Software Engineer at Poetic (from Fall 2021 -> Fall 2023)
- Program Fellow (iV9 from Summer 2023 -> Spring 2024) and iVenture Accelerator alum (iV8 from Summer 2022 -> Spring 2023)

I can find a practical and low-overhead way to send out my resume pdf. SST?

Apart from the beauty and entrepreneurial productivity of the iVenture community + the personal growth that evolved with me throughout building Poetic (reword that), what else is there to share? Do I really want to put on my music? (Oh I'll make an app for that). Close the gap between my Twitter and digital profile? Share pictures? I care about those things, and other people would love to see them. It would help my personal brand. But I need to be focused. What problem does this website solve? For whom does it solve for?

## Problem

- My socials need a website (Instagram, Twitter, GitHub)
- If I'm any good full-stack developer, I'd have a personal site that demonstrates that?? 😭 (mobile-first good-nav tailwind dark/light)
- socials -> brand > linktree
- Faster way to glance at my work experience for my Career, GitHub, and Twitter friends
- Better way to actually learn in-depth about the above. stories in bytes is easier than full writeups per important thing. think in features not versions
- I wish I was a good writer. I get by for now. Selling yourself is a fundamental skill of social creatures. If it's hard to sell by telling, then maybe I should take you straight to the code I'm trying to figure out too 😂. No need to stress about "ah I gotta build this for aslidjf reason" just build and comment and you good
- One place where I can complain about all the surprisingly shit software out there and Hopefully build it myself

## Participants

- Tech Twitter
- Instagram friends
- Developers on GitHub
- Entrepreneurial-minded friends from iVenture, UIUC, and beyond

# Bruhs

- Spotify live player is much better
- Apple Music search sucks
- Apple Music search bar on nav bar focuses keyboard
- Providers never in sync
- Apple Music full screen is simply gas
- Apple Music does not implement Optimistic UI, makes it confusing with my workflow: always sort big list of likes by recently added, shuffle and relike (change color of heart emoji to background, default black, to make UI fun to use)
- Apple Music lyrics are clean
- SoundCloud and YouTube have all the unreleased songs

Since there a few buckets that I need to write about, I'll separate into subdirectories.
