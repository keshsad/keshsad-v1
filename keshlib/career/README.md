Below are some things I found on the Internet to help people like me navigate careers:

## portfolio in progress

**Portfolio with Astro** <br />
Astro is a great choice because it lets me use any rendering library I'd like, including React, and is excellent for
creating effecient, fast websites. Deploying this on AWS through SST (and recently with [Ion](https://ion.sst.dev/)) aligns with
my preferred tools.

**Music App with Remix** <br />
Remix is a modern, fast, and feature-rich framework tailored for better user experiences and optimized loading. Hosting
this on AWS with SST also works well. You could use Next.js with SST or Vercel for this too, but I wanted to learn about web standards and
JavaScript.

**Therapy App with HTMX & Go** <br />
Giving HTMX a try would likely be a refreshing experience because it'll encourage me to do more with less JavaScript
which can lead to lots of performance benefits. Go is an effecient language that's great for creating high-performance
backends, and given my partnership with iVenture and the cloud computing benefits, GCP is a suitable choice.

**Internship in .NET** <br />
Yesterday I heard back from a company for my first ever technical interview. My referral said that if I can learn C#,
.NET, and the Microsoft stack, I'd get the job. He also said he hires 100% of the interns he signs in! I just needed to
get someone to throughly read through my experience in my resume... This also means I need to practice my DSA, learn
about the dotnet platform (Azure and ASP.NET), and hone my interviewing skills pretty quickly.

**Consistency with JavaScript** <br />
I believe staying within the JavaScript ecosystem makes sense. It has matured greatly and with frameworks like
React Native, mobile applications and Progressive Web Apps allows JavaScript to be catered towards mobile users
providing native-like experiences.

**Ecosystem Felexibility & Growth** <br />
I'm keeping myself open to multiple ecosystems (AWS and GCP) which is beneficial considering each cloud provider has its
unique strengths. I'm exploring multiple technologies (Remix, HTMX, Go, Astro), which not only will increase my skills
but also my understanding of different methodologies in web development.

**Future of Web Development** <br />
I can't help but think about the long-term vision of developing software on the web, for the web. I'm keeping an eye on
the potential of Javascript and CSS frameworks to create native movile apps which shows that I'm thinking ahead.
Assessing the value these technologies bring to my own personal specific projects is an exciting approach to becoming a
well rounded software engineer and contains plenty of learning opportunities. However, I shall remember that the
technologies are tools to achieve my goals, not goals in themselves.

## interviews

### technical interview questions

1. What programming languages do you know?

JS, C/CPP, Python, HTML/CSS, and soon HTMX + Golang :)
Can explain the thought process behind choosing to learn these languages.

2. What are some limitations of your favorite programming language?

My favorite is JS because it is responsible for creating the Internet as we know it. I think some of the biggest
limitations are:

- Historical baggage - while JS has evolved significantly over the years, it still carries some legacy aspects of
  awkward design decisions of the initial releases, leading to confusing syntax and methods, for example the `this`
  keyword within a method vs a regular function or callback, `null` is still considered to be `undefined` so
  unassigned variables equal both values, and Arrays are a type of object and not a separate entity which causes some
  unexpected behavior when type-checking or iterating through them. Overall, all the changes make it just that much more
  difficult for new developers to get up to speed.
- Single-threaded - while JS leverages asyncronous execution, it misses out on parallel processing or handling heavy
  computations.
- Lack of debugging - modern browsers are better (browser inconsistencies are also a problem), but JS debugging
  capabilities are quite deficient compared to languages like C or Java.

3. How do you go about deploying a product?

4. What are your steps invovled in a decision tree?

5. How do you determine what an end user needs?

6. Tell me how you'd debug an update.

7. What would you change about one of your favorite products?

One of my favorite products is a new browser called *Arc*, built by The Browser Company in New York. It reimagines the
way we interact with our Internet, prioritizes keybindings for effecienvy, and it releases a performance or design
update every Thursday.

One thing I'd modify in Arc is the excess features. We don't really need to take Notes in our web browser because there software dedicated just for that. The Company is doing a great job of this already, but I could imagine that open-sourcing such a product could lead to lots of excitement and rapid growth for not only the Company but the Internet as a whole. I'm sure many developers are curious as to how they are building their Swift app on Windows.
