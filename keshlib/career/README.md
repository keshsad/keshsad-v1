Below are some things I found on the Internet to help people like me navigate careers:

### technical interview questions

1. What programming languages do you know?

JS, C/CPP, Python, HTML/CSS, and soon HTMX + Golang :)
Can explain the thought process behind choosing to learn these languages.

2. What are some limitations of your favorite programming language?

My favorite is JS because it is responsible for creating the Internet as we know it. I think some of the biggest
limitations are:

- Historical baggage - while JS has evolved significantly over the years, it still carries some legacy aspects of
  awkward design decisions of the initial releases, leading to confusing syntax and methods, for example the `this`
  keyword within a method vs a regular function or callback, `null` is still considered to be `undefined` so
  unassigned variables equal both values, and Arrays are a type of object and not a separate entity which causes some
  unexpected behavior when type-checking or iterating through them. Overall, all the changes make it just that much more
  difficult for new developers to get up to speed.
- Single-threaded - while JS leverages asyncronous execution, it misses out on parallel processing or handling heavy
  computations.
- Lack of debugging - modern browsers are better (browser inconsistencies are also a problem), but JS debugging
  capabilities are quite deficient compared to languages like C or Java.

3. How do you go about deploying a product?

4. What are your steps invovled in a decision tree?

5. How do you determine what an end user needs?

6. Tell me how you'd debug an update.

7. What would you change about one of your favorite products?

One of my favorite products is a new browser called *Arc*, built by The Browser Company in New York. It reimagines the
way we interact with our Internet, prioritizes keybindings for effecienvy, and it releases a performance or design
update every Thursday.

One thing I'd modify in Arc is the excess features. We don't really need to take Notes in our web browser because there software dedicated just for that. The Company is doing a great job of this already, but I could imagine that open-sourcing such a product could lead to lots of excitement and rapid growth for not only the Company but the Internet as a whole. I'm sure many developers are curious as to how they are building their Swift app on Windows.
