### a better music experience

i think airbuds is a great step. i want to search and play my music from there too. or, i'll make it myself. inspired by [shadcn](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/apps/www/public/examples/music-dark.png).

- spotify live player is much better
- apple music search sucks
- apple music search bar on nav bar focuses keyboard
- providers never in sync
- apple music full screen is simply gas
- apple music does not implement optimistic ui, makes it confusing with my workflow: always sort big list of likes by recently added, shuffle and relike (change color of heart emoji to background, default black, to make ui fun to use)
- apple music lyrics are clean
- soundcloud and youtube have all the unreleased songs
- a consistently great group jam
