### notes

- solve the problem in my own life
- build with tools i already know
- launch multiple times
- good products don't need fancy bells

### concept

- marcus aurelius (stoic philosopher and roman emperor) wrote a personal collection of books to contemplate his life
- entrepreneurs wrote to think and ask themselves important intentional questions
- buddhist monks had scribes to preserve their practices and hone its benefits
- developers today write documentation to teach others
- many people around you journal personally for various reasons

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [vercel](https://vercel.com/home), and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/) that interested me.

### feature brainstorm

- daily prompts - choose from set of three Stoic-inspired questions, for waking up *and* before bed, like marcus
  aurelius
- cmd + j to get instant stoic-inspired feedback. cmd + l to start a situational conversation 
- notifications - subtle reminders to contextually enhance your daily experience of life

- everything markdown. users prolly don't care about that though. i'll use it to let users mark certain pieces of text
  that shouldn't be taken into account by the ai to reduce cost? markdown format let's user data stay liquid
- simple text area, allowing expected text input like bullets, lists, and indents, but also longer hierarchical
  narratives

- cloud and local storage
- generous free tier

- minimal interface
- quick access, easily accessible, streamlines (and only essential) menus

- pick your Stoic mentor
- ai learns from journal entries to compose an internal narrative portrait. share monthly
- simply sexy visualization of your awesome habit of journaling
- resources and education - stoic and buddhist reading material, paths, or concept maps, though this sounds more fitting in my [keshlib](../contemplation/)
- recommend readings and headspace meditations based on what's relevant in my writing
- structured challenges to properly approach, practice, and integrate Stoic and buddhist principles one by one in real life situations
- data export
- shared journal
- offline access to journals, read and write, sync once connected to Internet again
- downloadable content for open-source readings
- audio and video reflections could open doors to different types of reflective practice
- incorporate visual content or animations to help explain concepts in an engaging and intuitive way

## mvp

focus on core functionality that promotes for myself a Stoic lifestyle with my already established journaling habit.
includes Stoic questions, smooth journaling interface, provisions for personal reflections, and effecient data
management. beyond the mvp, i can extend features and refine the interface based on my own feedback.
