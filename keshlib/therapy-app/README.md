### a better therapy experience

in my junior year, i ran across a [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trained/id1414073313?i=1000417484122) with the senior director of performance at nike interviewing a british former buddhist monk. a pretty cool duo. i was deep into tennis at the time. it was also probably the best introduction i could've ever received.

i previously founded a startup to help songwriters write better lyrics on the rise of chatgpt. it was a really cool experience that nicely tied my hobby for listening to music to a constructive skill. moreover, i believe i started to care a lot more about the unique ability of humans to write. i was no good. there's a few examples:

- writing simply in entrepreneurship
- useful documentation for developers
- journaling
- thoughtful app content and tooltips
- buddhist monks and scribes that kept their practices

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about next.js, vercel, and tailwind. i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, the performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and the broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/).

let me tell you first that i was stuck in the abstracted yet beautiful land of vercel for quite a bit. after finding difficulties, i looked to meditations and was reminded to stay open-minded. change is inevitable, and any good experience is within my grasp. it's up to me to let go of difficulties and try new things. that's when i really started to look beyond the vercel world, paid attention to the sst team, and learned about remix and astro. i still saw go and solid doing great for people. the technological future is bright
