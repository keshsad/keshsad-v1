## a better therapy experience

in my junior year of highschool, i was deep into tennis. our season was cancelled due to the pandemic in 2020, so i
turned to the Internet to fill my time, perhaps like most kids my age. i came across a [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trained/id1414073313?i=1000417484122) where the senior director of performance at nike interviewed a british former buddhist monk. i was first seeking to improve my tennis game, but it became much more than that. it was the best introduction to meditation i could've ever received.

since then, i've been practicing meditation on and off. that's the great thing - there's no stress attached
to missing a meditation because you understand the next best thing is simply to pick it up when you can. no need
to beat yourself up over it. this mindset extended to the gym, rediscovering read, and to hanging with friends, and it
worked well for me. this was the first example of how meditation integrated into life. the monk i mentioned previously wrote a very digestible book: *the headspace guide to meditation by andy puddicombe*. there's also a wonderful series on netflix titled *guide to meditation*, intented for all ages and inquisitive individuals.

### why writing

upon arriving at the university, i met the most influential person with whom i later spent a lot of time. he was a talented writer, and he was the role model that sparked my fascination with the human ability of natural language. the best way
to describe myself would be that i was in *turmoil* to improve my neglected aspect of writing. while i
started an intermittent journaling habit after the podcast episode in high school, i started writing a little bit more
passionately since university. i was no good, but that meant i was quite keen to learn from examples:

- marcus aurelius (stoic philosopher and roman emperor) wrote a personal collection of books to contemplate his life
- entrepreneurs wrote to think and ask themselves important intentional questions
- buddhist monks had scribes to preserve their practices and hone its benefits
- developers today write documentation to teach others
- many people around you journal personally for various reasons

i enjoy that feeling after dumping my brain into my computer. during the process, not so much, because i was in
that turmoil to convey myself properly. i worried to improve the grammar of my writing, moving sentences such
that ideas become coherent, and rewriting over and over to find the [right words](https://onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=finding%20the%20right%20words%20at%20the%20right%20time). my diction was limited, i felt limited, and my confidence was not there. i looked so seriously beyond to those before me, those greater than me, that i did not see my
own self seriously. it was only myself that convinced me that i would never be capable enough to write usefully.

writing my assumptions helped me realize that's all bs.

i believe anyone can act in service. anyone can be useful. in the tech realm, anyone can write code, build product, and solve a problem for
those who need its solving. anyone can write in their native natural language and help someone else view the world with a different, perhaps
clearer lens. or at least, anyone can try. and if there's effort and iteration, there's progress and impact.

### concept

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [vercel](https://vercel.com/home), and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/) that interested me.

let me tell you, i was stuck in the abstract yet beautiful world of next.js/vercel for a while. after finding difficulties, i looked to meditations and was reminded to stay open-minded. change is inevitable, and any good experience is within my grasp. it's up to me to let go of difficulties and try new things. that's when i really started to look beyond the vercel world, paid attention to the [sst](https://sst.dev/) team, and learned about [remix](https://remix.run/) and [astro](https://astro.build/). i still thought about [htmx](https://htmx.org/), [go](https://go.dev/), and [solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/), but i have a long way to go before i'll feel i've gained and demonstrated sufficient proficiency in the bedrock principles of quality web development before moving on to different technologies. i see how all these new libraries are doing great for people. i'm very happy to say the technological future is bright.

### feature brainstorm

- daily prompts - choose from set of three Stoic-inspired questions, for waking up *and* before bed, like marcus
  aurelius
- cmd + j to get instant stoic-inspired feedback. cmd + l to start a situational conversation 
- notifications - subtle reminders to contextually enhance your daily experience of life

- everything markdown. users prolly don't care about that though. i'll use it to let users mark certain pieces of text
  that shouldn't be taken into account by the ai to reduce cost? markdown format let's user data stay liquid
- simple text area, allowing expected text input like bullets, lists, and indents, but also longer hierarchical
  narratives

- cloud and local storage
- generous free tier

- minimal interface
- quick access, easily accessible, streamlines (and only essential) menus

- pick your Stoic mentor
- ai learns from journal entries to compose an internal narrative portrait. share monthly
- simply sexy visualization of your awesome habit of journaling
- resources and education - stoic and buddhist reading material, paths, or concept maps, though this sounds more fitting in my [keshlib](../contemplation/)
- recommend readings and headspace meditations based on what's relevant in my writing
- structured challenges to properly approach, practice, and integrate Stoic and buddhist principles one by one in real life situations
- data export
- shared journal
- offline access to journals, read and write, sync once connected to Internet again
- downloadable content for open-source readings
- audio and video reflections could open doors to different types of reflective practice
- incorporate visual content or animations to help explain concepts in an engaging and intuitive way


## mvp

focus on core functionality that promotes for myself a Stoic lifestyle with my already established journaling habit.
includes Stoic questions, smooth journaling interface, provisions for personal reflections, and effecient data
management. beyond the mvp, i can extend features and refine the interface based on my own feedback.

### ui

### backend

### guidelines

ai-based apps should be transparent in their data usage and processing. explain to users how i use ai and how it'll benefit them. increase trust with clear explanations about how ai models work and how their data will be handled.
