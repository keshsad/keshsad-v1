## a better therapy experience

in my junior year of highschool, i was deep into tennis. our season was cancelled due to the pandemic in 2020, so i
turned to the Internet to fill my time, perhaps like most kids my age. i came across a [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trained/id1414073313?i=1000417484122) where the senior director of performance at nike interviewed a british former buddhist monk. i was first listening to improve my tennis game, but it became much more than that. it was the best introduction to the benefits of meditation i could've ever received.

since then, i've just been practicing meditation on and off. that's the great thing - there's no stress attached
to missing a meditation because you understand the next best thing is simply to do it the next time you can. no need
to beat yourself up over it. this mindset extended to the gym, to beginning to read, and to hanging with friends, and it
worked well for me. this was the first example of how meditation integrated into life. the monk i mentioned previously wrote a very digestible book: *the headspace guide to meditation by andy puddicombe*. there's also a wonderful series on netflix titled *guide to meditation*, intented for all ages and inquisitive individuals.

### why writing

upon arriving at university, i met the most impactful person in which i later spent lots of time with. he was a talented
writer, and he was the role model that sparked my fascination with the human ability of natural language. the best way
to describe myself would be that i was in *turmoil* to improve my neglected aspect of writing. while i
started an intermittent journaling habit after the podcast episode in high school, i started writing a little bit more
passionately since university. i was no good. but that meant i was quite keen to learn from examples:

- marcus aurelius (stoic philosopher and roman emperor) wrote a personal collection of books to contemplate his life
- entrepreneurs wrote to think and ask themselves important intentional questions
- buddhist monks had scribes to preserve their practices and hone its benefits
- developers today write documentation to teach others
- many people around you journal personally for many reasons

i enjoy that feeling after dumping my brain into my computer. during the process, not so much, because i was in
that turmoil to convey myself properly. i worried to improve the grammar of my writing, moving sentences such
that ideas become coherent, and rewriting over and over to find the [right words](https://onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=finding%20the%20right%20words%20at%20the%20right%20time). my diction was limited, i felt
limited. my confidence was not there. i looked so seriously beyond to those before me, those greater than me, that i did not see my
own self seriously. it was only myself that convinced myself that i would never be enough to write usefully.

that's bs.

i believe anyone can act in service. anyone can be useful. anyone can write code, build product, and solve a problem for
those who need its solving. anyone can write in their native language and help someone else view the world with a different, perhaps
clearer lens. or at least, anyone can try. and if there's effort and iteration, there's progress and impact.

### concept

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about next.js, vercel, and tailwind. i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/).

let me tell you first that i was stuck in the abstracted yet beautiful land of next/vercel for quite a bit. after finding difficulties, i looked to meditations and was reminded to stay open-minded. change is inevitable, and any good experience is within my grasp. it's up to me to let go of difficulties and try new things. that's when i really started to look beyond the vercel world, paid attention to the [sst](https://sst.dev/) team, and learned about [remix](https://remix.run/) and [astro](https://astro.build/). i still saw [htmx](https://htmx.org/)/[go](https://go.dev/) and [solidjs](https://www.solidjs.com/) doing great for people. the technological future is bright

### guidelines

ai-based apps should be transparent in their data usage and processing. explain to users how i use ai and how it'll benefit them. increase trust with clear explanations about how ai models work and how their data will be handled.
