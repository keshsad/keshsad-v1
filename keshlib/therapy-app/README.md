### notes

- solve the problem in my own life
- build with tools i already know (web first, native later)
- launch multiple times
- good products don't need fancy bells
- lose the perfectionism - it'll never be perfect anyways
- get to mvp quickly. minimum & viable bro
- subscription >> single payments. $1/week
- the benefits of a clear mind are underestimated

### concept

- marcus aurelius (stoic philosopher and roman emperor) wrote a personal collection of books to contemplate his life
- entrepreneurs wrote to think and ask themselves important intentional questions
- buddhist monks had scribes to preserve their practices and hone its benefits
- developers today write documentation to teach others
- many people around you journal personally for various reasons

i initially crafted this [concept](https://rishi-sadanandan-therapy.vercel.app/) as i learnt about [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), [vercel](https://vercel.com/home), and [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). i also grew fond of design by studying _refactoring ui_ by the tailwind team. since then, i've been focused on learning the fundamentals: html basics, performant serverless [javascript](https://github.com/getify/you-dont-know-js/tree/1st-ed), and broader [developer roadmaps](https://roadmap.sh/) that interested me.

### feature brainstorm

- daily prompts - choose from set of three Stoic-inspired questions, for waking up *and* before bed, like marcus
  aurelius
- cmd + j to get instant stoic-inspired feedback as a toast
- cmd + j (briefly hold) to start a situational conversation on the side
- cmd + k to open command bar (home, save, export, print)
- notifications - subtle reminders to contextually enhance your daily experience of life

- everything markdown so user data is liquid as possible
- simple text area, expecting bullets, lists, and indents, but also longer hierarchical narratives
- implement vim?

- cloud and local storage
- generous free tier

- minimal interface
- quick access, easily accessible, only essential menus
- never worry about titles: YYYY-MM-DD format
- "/" is default empty page
- "/nav" to navigate entries

- pick your Stoic mentor
- ai learns from journal entries to compose an internal narrative portrait. share monthly
- simply sexy visualization of your awesome habit of journaling
- resources and education - stoic and buddhist reading material, paths, or concept maps, though this sounds more fitting in my [keshlib](../contemplation/)
- recommend readings and headspace meditations based on what's relevant in my writing
- structured challenges to properly approach, practice, and integrate Stoic and buddhist principles one by one in real life situations
- data export
- shared journal
- offline access to journals, read and write, sync once connected to Internet again
- downloadable content for open-source readings
- audio and video reflections could open doors to different types of reflective practice
- incorporate visual content or animations to help explain concepts in an engaging and intuitive way

## mvp

focus on core functionality that promotes for myself a Stoic lifestyle with my already established journaling habit.
includes Stoic questions, smooth journaling interface, provisions for personal reflections, and effecient data
management. beyond the mvp, i can extend features and refine the interface based on my own feedback.
