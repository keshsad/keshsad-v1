### 3. a better fullstack entrepreneur experience

it's hard to be a developer. you can say it's even harder to be an entrepreneur. the biggest lessons i learned from both experiences is to:

- ask useful questions
- listen very closely

the problem is that there's a lot of questions and few good answers. a roadmap.sh would work.
