This is where I'll be keeping notes about learning .NET, C#, and the Microsoft ecosystem in general. My goal is to create a
website with ASP.NET to learn C# and demonstrate my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, scalable programming, and my ability to learn quickly.

** making a new ASP.NET web app in C#, HTMX, and Tailwind** <br />

I use HTMX because it lets me access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than through frameworks
or libraries. While React is a big part of the JavaScript ecosystem and probably offers the most job
opportunities and community support, I want a wider understanding of the web. Understanding the server-side
driven nature of HTMX would make me more adaptable and capable of working in environments that might not rely on
JavaScript framworks or SPAs. This has been more true for me than ever more recently. But for now, I'm not going to try
to and use React - I need to learn the web standards still. I also don't know what technologies from .NET will actually
be used, I might not even be contributing to web apps. So, the more C# the better.

I'll separate this section into something like so:
* C# basics and developer environments
    * Arrays are fixed
    * Neovim and VS Code
* C# principles and features
    * Type safety
    * Generics
    * Pattern matching
    * LINQ
    * Async
    * Records
* ASP.NET Core APIs (endpoints, auth, routes, https, debugging)
* Blazor (data forms, stores, security, and JS interop)
* MVC in ASP.NET:
    * clean model classes that are binded to a database
    * validation rules, working with data from the request path,
  body, and query string
    * views with Razor to render HTML/X content based on View
* real-time server-side updates with SignalR
* containerization and deployments

From what I've seen so far, there are three ways to build a web UI: with ASP.NET Core Blazor, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages,
or ASP.NET Core MVC. However, since they all fall under .NET, they would likely work well together. Instead of learning
both HTMX and C#, I'm just going to stick to one, and I'll probably use Blazor, since Microsoft copy likes that name a
lot.
