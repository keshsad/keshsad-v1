## question

can you point out a moment when you felt like "we might actually make it?" it can be personal, professional, startup
related, anything. doesn't need to be long; it'll be shared as a caption to an instagram post.

## final answer

"Extreme Ownership" - that's the title of Navy SEAL Jocko Willink's NYT bestseller on leadership and what fueled his unit's extraordinary success. It's also the best way I can describe the iVenture Accelerator's commitment to its startup founders. Through generous funding, mentorship, and pitch practice with all-star audiences, the iVenture leadership team took 110% responsibility to foster serendipitous success for all.

Throughout the program, we were challenged to be our best, transparent yet thoughtful, and like Jocko's SEAL team, learned that with great leaders, peers, disciplined effort, and a team working in sync, even first-time founders can make the impossible possible. For me that was imagining and realizing a vital toolkit for songwriters and rappers. ðŸŽ¶

Growing a startup is a really hard thing to do. I learned that we actually don't control external events, but rather our response to them. iVenture had the role models and mindset for me to respond like a champion. I'm thoroughly grateful for this world-class program transforming student entrepreneurship, which helped me realize that "making it" is not the real challenge. Instead, knowing exactly why you do what you do, and demonstrating the courage to do so, is exactly the challenge and value proposition that iVenture provides.
