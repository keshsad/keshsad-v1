### 3. a better fullstack entrepreneur experience

it's hard to be a developer. you can say it's even harder to be an entrepreneur. the problem is that there's a lot of questions and few good answers.

what if i, as a blessed young student founder, shared the pathway that i took to create something from nothing. my journey from a nobody (in my mind) to somebody that could potentially deliver value? i started to take myself more seriously when i was given the blessing and space to grow. not many people have had the opportunity i did, so young, at 18 years old.

it was through entrepreneurship that i at least earned some confidence. it was through entrepreneurship that i learned the value of engaging genuinely with role models and mentors. do you know what the word "sonder" means? i became open minded to the people around me, their lives and losses, their lessons and mistakes, their passions and indifference, their books and lectures.

i never read or wrote growing up. at all. except for school assignments. i never felt inclined to do such a thing. that was until i started applying to college, writing about myself. that was a really difficult thing for me to do: be vulnerable. i hated my own writing, yet i felt a certain connection to it. as if it was my ugly baby, i guess. that was inclination.

although i was so steadfast to apply to exclusively computer science or computer engineering programs, i didn't really know why i was doing what i was doing. sure i played with an arduino in high school to visualize music with led lights, but dude that was to distract myself from ap exams. i didn't even know what computer engineering was about. sure, it was about how computers worked, but who knew it was really all just on-and-off signals of bits, webbed together into a glorious ensemble of digital logic. "storing" bits and "memory" arrays blew my mind. however, i struggled very much in the higher level classes, having to retake some, failing out a few. not fun. couldn't hang with friends the same. couldn't see myself the same. grandparents had high hopes.

and there i was dedicating most of my time in college building a lyrical copilot with code, something i've again never done in my life.

first of all, my co-founder was amazing. he wasn't just my co-founder, he is still a good friend and easily the most influencial individual in my life. easily. he was exceptional at maintaining good conscience amidst the degenerate party culture at urbana champaign. he stood for what he believed in. he never shared his opinion too often. he said the right things at the right times, every single time.

so when we met at a startup-athon (mistook it for a hackathon but instead redirected the rest of my life), on an app to help rappers write better lyrics, you bet i was fucking ten toes down balls all the way into the fucking walls about figuring out success. then we were accepted into one of the top university startup accelerators in the nation. im no wise man, but i at least felt the magnitude of this opportunity.

my co-founder was an award-winning poet at a young age, and i wasn't feeling effectively literate. my co-founder was a beautiful tabla player, and i wasn't particularly musically adept. yet i felt the most inclined to learn to write, to express myself with clarity and fervor at will, and use words wisely. always been fascinated by that. here was a co-founder studying linguistics and computer science sent to me by God to perhaps mold my life.

people may have a variety of stories and reasons for why they do what they do. our startup accelerator program kicks off with a focus on exactly that. we went on a retreat to meet the crew, to learn about the program, and to reflect on our personal and professional purpose with our ventures. we were literally instructed to roam around the property for exactly 12 minutes and speak out loud to only ourselves about two questions:

1. why do you do what you do
2. how do you do what you do

do you feel how open ended this is? that retreat was, alongside my co-founders, the single greatest 48 hours of my life. i drove with the assistant director to get beer and snacks for a campfire too lol.

this is all to say, entrepreneurship is not what you think. it is instead just a representation of people. when you have great people, great talent, and great ethics, you have great entrepreneurship. that is iventure.

i believe anyone can tap into this. it is transcendental for sure. im not sure how to do it yet, but i know i can. i was a technical student founder. i learned lots of interesting things quickly. i also learned there is so much i do not know. i am now at an interesting stage, you see? thankfully i secured an internship for this summer (2024) at home, so i have the space and clarity to take a stab at this. my first goal is to create an app to help me think. shoutout sath and marcus aurelius.
