“Your first step is to write down the virtues exhibited by someone you respect. Listing the qualities you most admire in another person, just as Marcus does in the first book of The Meditations, is a simple and powerful exercise. He explains in a later chapter that he contemplates the virtues of those who lived with him in order to raise his spirits: the energy of one, the modesty of another, the generosity of a third, and so on. Nothing cheers our soul, he says, like the people close to us exhibiting virtue in their lives, and for that very reason we should treasure these examples and keep the memory of them fresh. Writing things down will often make the image more vivid and memorable. Stoics considered this a healthy source of joy. Writing down your ideas about what makes another person admirable, mulling them over, and revising them gives you an opportunity to process them. With practice, you will be able to visualize the character traits you’re describing more easily.”

The first three people that came to mind were Sath, Manu, and Prof Noah. The ingenuity and worldly knowledge of one, the
calm and confident practice of another, and the unrelenting warmth of the last. Each demonstrating the Stoic ideal
virtues of wisdom, courage, and justice.

Marcus likely asked himself what his role models would cope with a challenging situation. With the role models whose strengths I've identified, I might want to ask myself, for example:

- What would Marcus *do*?
- What would Marcus *say* about this?
